    [done]Reset to Idle Configuration
    [working]Preferences
    [working]About?

Preference Pane - global
    animation chooser
    ApplicationPrivatePortNumber, doesn't send the port to userDefaults, support multi-StatusThings
    connect NSPreferencePane to application
    populate NSPreferencePane bundle with controls
    animations in magnified exampleStatusView disappear halfway through animation
    [done]speed picker, allow users to choose how fast fast is.
    [done]scale up examplestatusview and actual size ( XXXL and Regular)
    [done]choose text string, font and fontSize
    [done]add lineWidth sliders

    [done]lock/unlock shape pickers
    [done]text field to enter JSON dictionaries to directly affect example status view, preview changes or something
    [done]create a NSPreferencePane bundle
    [done]position window at the center of the screen
    [done]close shared color panel when preference window closes

StatusListener
    use HTTP, browsers are now clients ( new HTTPListener? )
    Fallback to INET_ADDRANY and port 0 if the requested port is unavailable.
    Add listening on ipv6 port
    If using static port assignment and port is unavailable, make an error noise.
    [done]move controlling logic to StatusController where it belongs
    [done]extend protocol to ask delegate a question: what animations/shapes/filters are available, current configuration?
    [done]peer info dictionary
    [done]support toggling using bonjour
    [done]Re-design to allow for on-the-fly port change (stop, get new socket, start)
    [done]Support local-connections only mode
    [done]Modify protocol to include peer address (or insert it into the JSON message)
    [kept]sends a welcome string, probably not necessary?
    [done]should respond to "help" with a list of things that it understands
    [done]need to look into REST interface patterns?
    [done]Publish Bonjour service

    [done]close down connection when client sends EOF


AppleScript
    provide support for AppleScript - ugh.

Icon
    [done] horrible programmer art icon, sketch is awesome
    "kazoos are cool, kazoos all day suck"

Packaging?
    get autobuild number incrementing working
    define a release process
    [done]have Travis CI upload releases to GitHub
    [done] Configured Travis CI

Shapes
    Images supplied by client - integrate ASCIImage as an optional dependency
    WiFi-like fan thingy
    System template images

Licensing
    [done]Add a MIT license

Strategy
    One application per port
        or
    One application listening on a port manages N different StatusViews ( array of StatusViews ).
        when a client sets an attribute on an item, creates if DNE?
        associate StatusView with a client supplied tag
        restrict client access to only the statusviews they initiate?

Startup
    [NOT TESTED]Start on login - in preferences

Sparkle Integration - deferred

Python Client Bindings
    Adapt Demo script to have better modularity
    [done]Added a Demo python script which exercises statusthing.py
    [progress]make them suck less

Client Bindings
    [working]python
    ruby
    AppleScript
    native cocoa app
    - bonjour browser
    - user extendable catalog of configurations
    - send to one / many
