    Preferences
    About?
    Sparkle check for updates.


Preference Pane - per running instance?
    allow remote connections
    allow animations
    allow inset symbols
    allow notifications
    set limit on number of statusviews to create
    allow clients to create new statusviews
    blacklist clients
    whitelist clients
    change port on the fly

StatusListener
    Modify protocol to include peer address (or insert it into the JSON message)
    [kept]sends a welcome string, probably not necessary?
    [done]should respond to "help" with a list of things that it understands
    [done]need to look into REST interface patterns?
    [rejected]use HTTP, seems.. overkill-y?
    [done]Publish Bonjour service
    [done]bind to port 0 by default, OS picks an unused non-privileged port
    [done]close down connection when client sends EOF


AppleScript
    provide support for AppleScript - ugh.

NotificationCenter
    allow clients to generate Notifcations too?

Icon
    It Needs One.

Packaging?
    eventually

Shapes
    WiFi-like fan thingy
    Images supplied by client - integrate ASCIImage as an optional dependency
    System template images

Licensing
    Copyright messages in source need to be replace with CC appropriate verbiage

Strategy
    One application per port
        or
    One application listening on a port manages N different StatusViews ( array of StatusViews ).
        when a client sets an attribute on an item, creates if DNE?
        associate StatusView with a client supplied tag
        restrict client access to only the statusviews they initiate?

Startup
    Start on login

Update Checking Stuff
    Sparkle?

Client Bindings
    python
    ruby
    AppleScript
    native cocoa app
