    shine
    twinkle
    lens flare
    halo 

Interface builder
    put something in Credits.rtf
    [done]build menus with IB instead of programatically

    Instead of a history menu item ("Messages") let Notifications keep a record of stuff.
    Save history to a CSV?

StatusViewArrayController
StatusViewArray

Error Handling
    Fail when unable to bind the given port
    [done]Send error notices back to clients when JSON doesn't work out

JSON dispatch object
    [fixed]Take the smarts out of the various Status* objects
    [done]May need a few command-type verbs like reset and help

statusItemMenu
    Sparkle check for updates.
    messages subMenu holding list of messages
    message dict: { from:"Girl Behind You" body:"Do you like me" reply:{ "YES":"sweet!","NO":"bogus!"}}
    [done]Reset to Idle Configuration
    [working]Preferences
    [working]About?

Preference Pane - global
    animation chooser
    filter chooser
    choose text string, font and fontSize
    add lineWidth sliders
    ApplicationPrivatePortNumber, doesn't send the port to userDefaults
    connect NSPreferencePane to applicaition
    populate NSPreferencePane bundle with controls
    [done]create a NSPreferencePane bundle
    [done]position window at the center of the screen
    [done]close shared color panel when preference window closes

    [done]allow remote connections
    [done]allow animations
    [done]enable/disable launch at login
    [done]pick colors and shape of idle icon
    [done]use Bonjour or static port
    [deferred]allow notifications
    [deferred]set limit on number of statusviews to create
    [deferred]allow clients to create new statusviews
    [deferred]blacklist clients
    [deferred]whitelist clients


StatusListener
    use HTTP, browsers are now clients ( new HTTPListener? )
    Fallback to INET_ADDRANY and port 0 if the requested port is unavailable.
    Add listening on ipv6 port
    If using static port assignment and port is unavailable, make an error noise.
    [done]move controlling logic to StatusController where it belongs
    [done]extend protocol to ask delegate a question: what animations/shapes/filters are available, current configuration?
    [done]peer info dictionary
    [done]support toggling using bonjour
    [done]Re-design to allow for on-the-fly port change (stop, get new socket, start)
    [done]Support local-connections only mode
    [done]Modify protocol to include peer address (or insert it into the JSON message)
    [kept]sends a welcome string, probably not necessary?
    [done]should respond to "help" with a list of things that it understands
    [done]need to look into REST interface patterns?
    [done]Publish Bonjour service
    [done]bind to port 0 by default, OS picks an unused non-privileged port
    [done]close down connection when client sends EOF


AppleScript
    provide support for AppleScript - ugh.

Icon
    [done] horrible programmer art icon, sketch is awesome
    "kazoos are cool, kazoos all day suck"

Packaging?
    Do I need a dmg or pkg applicaiton packaging?
    define a release process
    [done]have Travis CI upload releases to GitHub
    [done] Configured Travis CI

Shapes
    Images supplied by client - integrate ASCIImage as an optional dependency
    WiFi-like fan thingy
    System template images

Licensing
    Copyright messages in source needs to be replace with CC appropriate verbiage

Strategy
    One application per port
        or
    One application listening on a port manages N different StatusViews ( array of StatusViews ).
        when a client sets an attribute on an item, creates if DNE?
        associate StatusView with a client supplied tag
        restrict client access to only the statusviews they initiate?

Startup
    [NOT TESTED]Start on login - in preferences

Update Checking Stuff
    Sparkle? On hold until Travis CI can send builds to Github
    need to learn how to use cocoapods

Python Client Bindings
    Adapt Demo script to have better modularity
    [done]Added a Demo python script which exercises statusthing.py
    [progress]make them suck less

Client Bindings
    [working]python
    ruby
    AppleScript
    native cocoa app
    - bonjour browser
    - user extendable catalog of configurations
    - send to one / many
