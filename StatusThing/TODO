Command line argument processing
    specify listening port number
    specify starting shape|color|symbol|symbolcolor|animation



StatusView
    implement shapes as layers to help with animations

StatusView animations
    throb - animate alpha? cancel when statusItem clicked?

Error Handling
    Fail when unable to bind the given port
    Send error notices back to clients when JSON doesn't work out

JSON dispatch object
    Take the smarts out of the various Status* objects
    Use more KVC

Menu
    messages menuItem with sub-menus holding message list and a clear item
    Preferences

Preference Pane - per running instance?
    allow remote connections
    allow animations
    allow inset symbols
    change port on the fly

StatusLister
    sends a welcome string, probably not necessary
    should respond to "help" with a list of things that it understands
    need to look into REST interfaces?
    use HTTP, seems.. overkill-y?


Broken
    JSON sourced dictionaries not distributed to StatusView or StatusMenu
