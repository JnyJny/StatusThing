Preference Pane - global
    animation chooser
    filter chooser

StatusListener
    use HTTP, browsers are now clients ( new HTTPListener? )
    Fallback to INET_ADDRANY and port 0 if the requested port is unavailable.
    Add listening on ipv6 port
    extend protocol to ask delegate a question: what animations/shapes/filters are available, current configuration?

AppleScript
    provide support for AppleScript - ugh.

Icon

Packaging?
    eventually

Shapes

    System template images

Licensing
    Copyright messages in source needs to be replace with CC appropriate verbiage

Strategy
    One application per port
        or
    One application listening on a port manages N different StatusViews ( array of StatusViews ).
        when a client sets an attribute on an item, creates if DNE?
        associate StatusView with a client supplied tag
        restrict client access to only the statusviews they initiate?

Startup
    [NOT TESTED]Start on login - in preferences

Update Checking Stuff
    Sparkle?
