JSON:
{"shape":..,"background":{..}"foreground":{..},"text":{..}}

One dictionary per line, dictionaries may be nested.

Shape:
The shape key has a string value which should be one of the following:

none|circle|line|triangle|square|diamond|roundedsquare
pentagon|hexagon|septagon|octagon|nonagon|decagon|endecagon
triagram|quadragram|pentagram|hexagram|septagram|octagram
nonagram|decagram|endecagram

Background and Foreground Dictionaries:
{"fill"        :color,
 "stroke"      :color,
 "lineWidth"   :float,
 "color"       :synonym for background.fill or foreground.stroke
 "hidden"      :0|1},
animation-name:[0|1]|["slowest|slower|slow|normal|fast|faster|fastest"] }

Text Layer Dictionary:
{"string"      :string,
 "font"        :string,
 "fontSize"    :float,
 "foreground"  :color,
 "color"       :synonym for foreground
 "hidden"      :0|1",
 animation-name:[0|1]|["slowest|slower|slow|normal|fast|faster|fastest"] }

Strings matching "\[uU][0-9a-fA-F]+" can be used to specify a
Unicode character. Note that not all fonts implement all characters.

Colors:
"colorName"
{"red":float,"green":float,"blue":float,"alpha":float}

Color dictionary components default to zero if they are missing.
Component values are expected to be between 0.0 and 1.0 or 0 and 255.

Animations

Multiple animations can be specified in dictionaries for any layer.
Animation entries consist of a name and boolean pair.
Valid animation names are; spin, spincw, spinccw, throb, bounce,
shake, flip, flipy, flipx, wobble, blink, enbiggen, stretch.
